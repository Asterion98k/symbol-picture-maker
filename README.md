# symbol-picture-maker
(as a gift for cpp)

Though I'm not the first to make symbol pictures, I prefer to do it my way!
Implementing the opencv, the program can convert pictures to a new matrix of brailles which looks almost the same to the original ones. 

To produce an ideal symbol picture, you still have to try different parameters defined at the begining of the program. According to my experience, this program can't handle low-contrast pictures. But if you are interested and willing to improve the performance of this program, I'll be grateful.

## Requirements:
- Python v3.6.7
- Flask v1.0.2
